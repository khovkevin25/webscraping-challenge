# webscraping-challenge

## Kevin Khov

In this challenge, we were tasked to read and perform an analysis using web-scraping on a website containing news and data on Mars. There were two deliverables for this challenge: web-scraping the website to preview article titles and texts, and web-scraping the website to perform an analysis on weather variables, such as temperature and atmospheric pressure, on Mars.

For the first deliverable, the code used to perform the web-scraping to return article titles and texts can be found in "part_1_mars_news.ipynb". For the second deliverable, the code used to perform the web-scraping and subsequent data analysis on the website can be found in "part_2_mars_weather.ipynb". The data that was exported in this code can be found in "mars_data.csv".
